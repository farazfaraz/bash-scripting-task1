# My Project
#### Write a script to get a path from the user, make a backup, compress it and send it to an S3 bucket. For S3 storage, you can use Amazon S3 or MinIO in on-perm environments.

# The way of deploy and use the project
#### 1) Transform the project into an executable project : chmod +x BachupToStorage.sh
#### 2) run the program passing a path as an argument where you want to do backup: ./BackupToStorage.sh --path /your-path
